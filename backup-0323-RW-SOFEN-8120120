# Explanation of the script:
# - This script creates a backup of a directory and copies it to a remote server.
# - It requires the remote server details such as hostname, username, password, and directory path.
# - It also creates a backup directory locally based on the negpod_id.
# - The 'scp' command is used to securely copy the directory to the remote server.
# - Finally, it outputs a message indicating the successful creation of the backup.
